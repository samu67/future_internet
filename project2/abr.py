        playback_time - how much of the video has been shown (in seconds)
        playback_chunk - the chunk that is playing right now
        current_chunk - the chunk number that is downloading right now (or has been just finished)
        current_chunk_quality - the quality of the current_chunk

        ABR function returns the next chunk that should be downloaded
           * quality_to_download_now - quality of the next chunk from 0 to 5
           * chunk_to_download_now   - chunk number of the chunk that should be downloaded
                                     - next_chunk cannot be in the past, if the player plays chunk 10, chunk 9 shouldn't be downloaded
                                     - if you set next_chunk to -1, no chunk will be downloaded
                                     - if the previou download hasn't been completed (e.g. in case of rebuffering) you can change the chunk
                                       that is currently downloading. For instance, you started downloading a high quality chunk, but
                                       rebuffering happened and now you would like to lower the quality. In that case, return the same chunk
                                       number, but different quality.
           * timeout    - set a timer that will trigger the abr function again
                        - timeout is in absolute time, usually set it as current_time+X (where min X is 200ms)
                        - timeout 0 means no timeout
